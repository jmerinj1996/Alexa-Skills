## Alexa reads encouraging quotes from reddit
Since Flask-ask is an extension of Flask, the code will look very similar to Flask.

For this code to work, you would need to create a reddit account.
In the code where it says YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_PASSWORD, you are required to fill in your username and password


Now, you can ask your Alexa device: "Alexa, start Reddit Reader." You will be asked if you want to hear some quotes to which you can either respond "yes" or "no." If you say "yes" you will get the quotes and then the skill will end. If you respond "no," then the skill will end.
