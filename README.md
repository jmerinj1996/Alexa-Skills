# Fun-Projects
These are projects I've done as a result of watching so many interesting tutorials online.

They have certainly expanded my skill set and opened my eyes to various concepts and ideas that never could be got out of an engneering text book!

### 1. Alexa reads encouraging quotes from reddit
This was super fun project to work on simply because you got to hear what you wrote with Alexa's lovely voice. (Not to mention all the silly things I made her read)
##### Skills learnt : 
* Developing an Alexa skill
* Python Flask-Ask
* Work with reddit and ngrok
