# Fun-Projects
These are projects I've done as a result of watching so many interesting tutorials online.

They have certainly expanded my skill set and opened my eyes to various concepts and ideas that never could be got out of an engneering text book!

### 1. Alexa reads encouraging quotes from reddit
This was super fun project to work on simply because you got to hear what you wrote with Alexa's lovely voice. (Not to mention all the silly things I made her read)
##### Skills learnt : 
* Developing an Alexa skill
* Python Flask-Ask
* Work with reddit and ngrok

### 2. Deep Neural Network applied to sentiment dataset
Here we build a deep neural network that is applied on positive and negative sentiment statements. This involved a little bit of natural language processing as well.
##### Skills learnt : 
* Using Tensorflow
* Using nltk modules to tokenize and lemmatize sentiment data
* Pickling

### 3.Convolution Neural Network on Dog vs Cat Kaggle dataset
This project involves applying a convolution neural network on a Kaggle dataset. We used an abstraction layer over TensorFlow to make the code simple and less error prone.
##### Skills learnt : 
* Using TFLearn 
* Using cv2
* tqdm
